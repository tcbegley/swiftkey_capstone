# Swiftkey Capstone
This repository contains code I wrote to complete the Swiftkey capstone project as part of the Data Science Specialisation on Coursera.

## Overview

The `.Rmd` file for my milestone report can be found in the `milestone` subdirectory. The scripts `build_model.R` and `predict2.R` contain R code to build the model from the data and implement the prediction algorithm respectively. Finally the `predictr` subdirectory contains all of the code and data used for the shiny app.
